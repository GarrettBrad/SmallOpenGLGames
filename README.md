# Overview
These small games were made mainly as projects to help me learn C++. There where other reasons for them such as making games with and without using a game engine.

## Pong
This was the first game created just a simple small game.

## Snake
The second to come. Another small game just to teach me some basics

## Skeleton Adventure
A semi big project that I wanted to make after I found the model while browsing reddit.
